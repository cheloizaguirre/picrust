# picrust
This project is an exercise in learning Rust and the [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine. The plan is for this to be a simple Picross-like game.

## Current state
Doesn't do much, really. If you click "solve", the puzzle will get auto-solved.

## How do I run it?
Since there's no built release, you have to build it yourself. Here's the simplest route:
1. Get Rust! (why don't you have it already?) Instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone the code and go to thata folder
3. cargo run --release
4. Play!
